# This file will be installed into /etc/apache2 when you first emerge
# Apache2.  If/when you upgrade, it will be consulted for your options,
# thus preserving your previous configuration.  The default configuration
# in files/ is used if the one in /etc/apache2 isn't available.
#
# The syntax in this file has recently changed. To build a static module, put
# 'static' next to it. To build a DSO module, put 'shared' next to it. To
# disable a module (i.e. not built at all), put 'disabled' next to it.
#
# Examples:
# mod_access shared    ( this would build a DSO )
# mod_actions static   ( this would get compiled statically )
# - mod_alias shared   ( this module would not be built at all )
#
# Also new with 2.0, any shared modules defined in this file will have
# LoadModule lines placed in the configuration for them.
#
# WARNING: Edit this file at your own risk! Some modules depend on other
# modules being enabled as well - make sure you have everything satisfied, or
# your apache may not compile or work correctly.
