<IfDefine DEFAULT_VHOST>
# Virtual Hosts
#
# If you want to maintain multiple domains/hostnames on your
# machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them. Most configurations
# use only name-based virtual hosts so the server doesn't need to worry about
# IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.
#
# Please see the documentation at 
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/vhosts/>
# for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.
#
# You may use the command line option '-S' to verify your virtual host
# configuration.

# Use name-based virtual hosting.
#
NameVirtualHost *:80

# When virtual hosts are enabled, the main host defined in the default
# httpd.conf configuration will go away. We redefine it here so that it is
# still available.
#
# If you disable this vhost by removing -D DEFAULT_VHOST from
# /etc/conf.d/apache2, the first defined virtual host elsewhere will be
# the default.
#

<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerName localhost
	ServerAdmin root@localhost
	DocumentRoot "/var/www/localhost/htdocs"
	
	<IfModule mpm_peruser_module>
		ServerEnvironment apache apache
	</IfModule>
