# Server-Pool Management (MPM specific)

#
# PidFile: The file in which the server should record its process
# identification number when it starts.
#
# Note that this is the default PidFile for most MPMs.

PidFile /var/run/apache2.pid

#
# The accept serialization lock file MUST BE STORED ON A LOCAL DISK.

#LockFile /var/run/apache2.lock

#
# Only one of the below sections will be relevant on your
# installed httpd.  Use "/usr/sbin/apache2 -l" to find out the
# active mpm.
#

# prefork MPM
#
# This is the default MPM if USE=-threads
#
# StartServers: number of server processes to start
# MinSpareServers: minimum number of server processes which are kept spare
# MaxSpareServers: maximum number of server processes which are kept spare
# MaxClients: maximum number of server processes allowed to start
# MaxRequestsPerChild: maximum number of requests a server process serves

# worker MPM
#
# This is the default MPM if USE=threads
#
# StartServers: initial number of server processes to start
# MaxClients: maximum number of simultaneous client connections
# MinSpareThreads: minimum number of worker threads which are kept spare
# MaxSpareThreads: maximum number of worker threads which are kept spare
# ThreadsPerChild: constant number of worker threads in each server process
# MaxRequestsPerChild: maximum number of requests a server process serves

# event MPM
#
# If you are using this MPM, then it's assumed you know what you are doing,
# and you can write your own configuration.
# Hint: This is based off of the worker MPM
